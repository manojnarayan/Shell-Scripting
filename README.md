# Shell-Scripting

Certainly! Shell scripts in Linux are text files containing a series of commands that are executed by the shell interpreter. These scripts can automate tasks, perform system administration tasks, or execute a series of commands sequentially. Here's a simple example of a shell script:

(EXAMPLE) :----
#!/bin/bash

# This is a comment. It starts with a '#' symbol and is ignored by the shell.

# Print a welcome message
echo "Welcome to my first shell script!"

# Print the current date and time
echo "The current date and time is: $(date)"

# Print the contents of the current directory
echo "Contents of the current directory:"
ls

# Check if a file exists in the current directory
if [ -f "example.txt" ]; then
    echo "The file 'example.txt' exists."
else
    echo "The file 'example.txt' does not exist."
fi

Explanation:

1)The first line #!/bin/bash is called a shebang and indicates that the script should be interpreted using the Bash shell.
2)Comments start with # and are ignored by the shell. They are used to provide explanations or context for the commands.
3)echo is used to print messages to the terminal.
4)$(date) is a command substitution that executes the date command and substitutes its output into the echo command.
5)ls lists the contents of the current directory.
6)The if statement checks if a file named example.txt exists in the current directory using the -f test operator.

To use this script:

1)Copy the script into a text file (e.g., myscript.sh).
2)Make the script executable using the chmod command: chmod +x myscript.sh.
3)Run the script: ./myscript.sh.

This script is just a basic example. Shell scripts can be much more complex and can include loops, conditional statements, functions, and more, allowing for powerful automation and system administration tasks in Linux.
